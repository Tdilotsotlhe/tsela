A simple api for street name completion in south africa.  Each municipality has a general valuation roll, which will be used as the source of street addresses. Hoping to get more information from a town planner. Starting with Kuruman.

Assuming all data follows the conventions of SANS 1883 on address standards...dont think it even applies here.
